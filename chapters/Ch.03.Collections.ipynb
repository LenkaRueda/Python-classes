    "# Collections \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many ways in which to organise a collection of data. Computer scientists often search for interesting ways to collect and structure data. Some reasons are to make its storage and retrieval more robust and efficient. Later on you will find some structures work better than others for a task at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to focus on three main kinds of collections which are extremely common and impressively versatile: `list`, `set`, and dictionary (or `dict`). Getting used to the logic of these three will enable you to manage a huge amount situations in programming. Other, fancier, and more abstract packages will come along for specific tasks, but these three are the most important. \n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about collections that matters most is how they associate data. Each type of collection may associate data in a different way. You might have guessed from the discussion so far that lists place data in some ordered sequence. We would say that a list orders `by position`. A set, by contrast, does not really have a notion of position. There's not element guaranteed to be first or last when you print a set. Instead, a set is ordered `by inclusion`. This means that some object or data is either in a set or not in a set. Finally a dictionary is ordered `by key`. Keys are like an index for more data. We will show what keys mean after covering lists and sets more fully first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all collections in Python are iterable. This means that you can ask for one item from the set and then keep asking until you get all the items. Sometimes the order might be different depending on the type of collection, but you will definitely get through all of them eventually. We will iterate through collections in the next chapter.  "

In a dictionary we look up that value _by key_. But we still use `[]` to look it up.

    "Herein we have seen a number of collections. We focused on three main ones, `list`, `set`, and `dict`. Yet, in the course of working through these, we also encountered tuples, `dict_items`, `dict_values`, and `dict_keys`. Yet, these other collections tend to work in pretty similar ways. Ultimately, if we have a collection we need a way to access the data from that collection. That's why I chose `list`, `set`, and `dict`. They exemplify three key ways of ordering (and thus querying) for data: by position, by inclusion, and by key. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter we will make use of collections through iteration. We will be able to do something for each element in a collection, or only under certain conditions. \n",

    "The exercises in Appendix \\ref{ap:short} enable some practice with dictionaries, and particularly some objects that are a messy of nested lists and dictionaries. This will start to resemble some of the messy data structures we see in the real world, like JSON (which really resembles combinations of lists and dictionaries).  "

This means they will have an input device (typically a keyboard but could be any sensor), a processor that does calculations, memory (typically fast memory such as RAM and slow memory such as a Hard Drive for more long term storage) and an output device (often, but not necessarily a screen). Other architectures based on state machines and quantum computing exist but are often experimental and not quite relevant at the moment. \n",

Under the root directory would be child directories. Even though it can be characterised as a 'tree', we tend to use the terms children and parent. Perhaps think of it more like a family tree, a very peculiar family tree. \n",

    "Windows was a small operating system back in the day. It wanted to preserve backwards compatibility with earlier DOS systems and IBM systems, but the `/` was already used in systems as a 'switch' meaning it would not be easy (so it seemed) to use it to denote directory structures. Thus, __`\\`__ was used instead since it looks similar. It didn't seem like a big deal at a time, but it has certainly become a nuisance for programmers ever since. Along with some other quirks, such as the drives as having letter names, means that there are a number of little differences between Windows and \\*Nix users. \n",

    "In the code herein, I want to have notes that are as generic as possible across systems as well as notes that are 'robust'. So I will be using some Python libraries to ensure the code stays consistent. In particular we will be using the `os` module, as you will likely see a lot of code snippets that use this module. I will also be using the `pathlib` library, which has been available since Python 3.4. I think it is more tidy and coherent than the earlier `os` module, but it is less commonly used still. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `os` library is a variable called `os.sep`. If you print it on Windows it will print a `\\` and if you print on a \\*Nix system it will print `/`. You can use this to build a string representing path that are operating system independent. However, a more robust way is to use `pathlib` to create a Path object, for example: \n",

So our root directory contains other directories, which can contain more directories themselves. On \\*Nix, the topmost directory for the OS is usually simply `/` or _\"root\"_. For windows there is no single topmost directory, but rather a set of drives. The operating system lives on the `C` drive. So you might have `C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla\\Firefox.exe` as a path to a browser. Whereas on Mac it would be `/Applications/Firefox.app`.  \n",

This location may or may not exist on your directory, but it is still a Path object. You could instatiate `Path('dfasdfjlsfgg/fsadgag')` but it would not work if you try to search there for a file.

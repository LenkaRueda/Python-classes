# Introducing Python

An introductory course on Python Programming from Bernie Hogan at the Oxford Internet Institute. This course goes through some of the basics of Python using Jupyter Lab. The course can be considered as a printed book (PDF) or as a series of Jupyter Lab workbooks. The workbooks will allow you to run the code yourself and tinker with it. These can be run on your own machine by cloning this repository to your desktop. You can also save the raw files as `*.ipynb` (such as `Ch.00.Prologue.ipynb`) and run them locally. You can alternatively run them online using the buttons at the top of each file that signal "Run in Colab" or "launch Binder", like the following:

## Table of contents: 
- Prologue. A short introduction and welcome. 
- Chapter 1. An orientation to Jupyter Lab and programming in Python.
- Chpater 2. Introducing simple data types: from characters to numbers to strings
- Chapter 3. Collections: ordering data by position, index, and membership
- Chapter 4. Conditionals, loops, and errors: How to change the flow of a program
- Chapter 5. Functions and object-oriented programming: Using abstraction to limit redundancy
- Chpater 6. The file system
- Exercises. Three exercises with some tips in a long answer sheet. 

This course does not have a large number of exercises. Instead, there are at the end a small number of projects that you might want to complete in order to get a feel for the material and show some of your creativity along the way. This book runs through pretty well-worn territory and despite its inclusion in a social science degree, there is not much social science here. Instead, these are the basic grammar of Python that you would use regardless of your eventual destination. 

For social science, computational social science, and some data science students, I would then recommend my forthcoming book, "From Social Science to Data Science", which goes through the next set of skills. These include how to wrangle data, collect data using an API, merge data, and look at social data as text, networks, and geographies. It is due out in December 2022.
